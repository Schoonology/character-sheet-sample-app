# Sample App: Dungeons and Dragons Character Sheet

A sample application based on TTRPG character sheets. Each directory covers an implementation based on a library, either the standard library of a langauge or a third-party library.

Each directory has the same usage: Run `make start` to start the server, which will log the URL to visit to create, update, and use the character sheet.
